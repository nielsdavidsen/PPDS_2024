#Run-time optimization
#the less loops the better
#lesser repetitions, dont put anything inside a loop which doesnt vary

#Quantifying the speed of an algorithm, should be expressed as a function of input size, not time

#Big O, 0(n), notation is a way to describe the upper bound of the speed of an algorithm, its the computational complexity


#Binary search is O(log(n)), linear search is O(n), loop inside of loop is O(n^2)
